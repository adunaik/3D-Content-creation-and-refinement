# 3D-Content-creation-and-refinement

This repository focuses on generating diverse 3D point clouds from single-view 2D RGB images. The project utilizes a pretrained architecture known as 3DAttributeFlow to achieve this.

# Introduction

In this approach, we perform interpolation in the latent space between a source and a target, enabling the generation of a wide range of 3D point clouds. This method leverages the capabilities of the pretrained model to produce diverse and visually appealing 3D content from 2D inputs.
